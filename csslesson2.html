    <h2>What is the div element</h2>
    <h2>The div element is a like bucket that groups sections of a webpage together. All div elements you call in your CSS will be impacted by the styling you apply to it. If you want to target a div individually,you need a way to identify them.</h2>

    <h2>What is one way you can identify or "target" a div element?</h2>
    <h2>A div can be identified or “targeted” in several different ways. For today, we are going to focus on classes. When you are calling a class in CSS, it will target every div with the same class. You can repeat styling across a website using the same class without having to repeat the CSS.</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>why would you use a div element?</h2>
    <h2>To target a specific div, call the class. All div elements that share a class will have the same styling. The class is case sensitive and there must be a period . before it. If you would like to target specific elements in a div, call it in the CSS.</h2>
